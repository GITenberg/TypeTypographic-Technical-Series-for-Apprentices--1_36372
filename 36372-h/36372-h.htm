<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This treatise is the first of a series of text-books, published under
the general title of <i>Typographic Technical Series for Apprentices</i>,
which have been prepared under the auspices of the Committee on
Education of the United Typothetae of America, for the use of
printers&#8217; apprentices and students of typographic printing.</p>

<p>As will be noted by the table of contents, only the mechanical
features of type and the usual methods of its manufacture have been
considered here. No attempt has been made to review the history of
type-faces or the development of type-making processes. These phases
of the subject are considered in other publications of the series (see
<a href="#Page_i">p. 36</a>) and in supplementary reading recommended for students (<a href="#Page_28">p. 28</a>).</p>

<p>It is not what they are but what they can be made to do under the
control of trained intelligence and skilful hands that makes printer&#8217;s
types of importance to the world. No tools used in modern industry
seem simpler than these little pieces of metal, yet they are the
product of the most highly specialized skill and ingeniously perfected
mechanisms. To the young printer their physical elements are matters
of first concern. An understanding of these elements may be only a
small part of his trade education, but it is important. The
possibilities and the limitations of type can be appreciated only by
thorough familiarity with the technical details and niceties provided
by the modern typefounder.</p>

<p>A special feature of this series of technical publications is the list
of Review Questions, which will be found at the end of each treatise
(see <a href="#Page_29">pp. 29-31</a>). These questions cover the essential points in each
subject and will be of assistance to instructors, for examinations,
etc. A list of the other titles of the series, as well as a statement
of their plan and scope, will be found on <a href="#Page_i">pp. i-vii</a> of this
publication.</p>

<h2>MECHANICAL FEATURES OF TYPE</h2>

<div class="figright">

<a href="images/p07-f.png"><img src="images/p07-s.png" width="50" height="178"
alt="[A piece of metal type]" /></a>
</div>

<p>Printing owes its development first and chiefly to movable metal
types. The so-called invention of printing was the discovery of a
method of making serviceable type in quantity. The idea of a separate
type for each letter of the alphabet was probably conceived long
before Gutenberg&#8217;s time, but it remained for him and his associates to
devise an apparatus for making them quickly and accurately enough to
be of practical value. That apparatus was the type mold, which
experience has since proved to be the most efficient means of securing
exactness and uniformity in a number of small pieces of metal.</p>

<p>Type is made of an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony. Its length
(technically called height-to-paper) is .918 of an inch. Each type is
cast separately in a mold, and has the letter or printing character in
bold relief on one end.</p>

<p>Exact uniformity of body is necessary in order that the types, when
composed in lines and pages, may be locked together by pressure at the
sides so as to make a compact mass. All types in a printing form must
be of the same height, so that their faces may present a uniformly
level surface from which an impression may be made that will show all
the characters clearly. A short type will print faintly or will not
print at all, while a long one will be unduly forced into the sheet.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<a name="image-0002" id="image-0002"><!--IMG--></a>
<a href="images/p08a-f.png"><img src="images/p08a-s.png" width="254" height="40"
alt="[Diagram of a line of metal type]" /></a>
</div>

<p>There are on an average about one hundred and fifty roman letters and
other characters required in ordinary book printing. These letters are
divided into a number of classes: full-body letters, ascending
letters, descending letters, short letters; and in some cases, small
capitals, which are larger than short letters but not so tall as
capitals or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> ascenders. Only a few letters, like J and Q, cover
nearly the entire surface on the end of the type; other letters, like
B h l i, cover the upper portion chiefly and leave a blank space at
the bottom; while the small letters, like a e o u v, occupy only the
middle portion of the surface; still others, like g y p, cover the
middle and lower portions of the surface. As all these irregular
shapes must be made to appear in line with each other, the type-body
on which they are made is larger than the letter. The blank parts
around the face of a letter are called the counter, the shoulder, and
the beard. The counter is the shallow place between the lines of the
face. The shoulder is the low flat part of the type around the face.
The beard is the sloping part between the face and the shoulder.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a name="image-0003" id="image-0003"><!--IMG--></a>

J J, the feet<br />
K, the groove
</span>
</div>

<p>An important feature of a type is the nick on the side of the body. In
many cases there may be two, three, or even four nicks on a type.
Usually all the types of a font have nicks that are identical in
number and position, and when the types are composed in lines these
nicks match each other and form continuous grooves on the lower part
of the line of type.</p>

<p>The nicks serve as guides to the compositor when taking the type from
the case to his composing stick, and they assist in distinguishing the
types of one font or face from those of another on the same size of
body.<small><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1" href="#f1">[1]</a></small> Individual letters of different type faces sometimes bear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>such close resemblance that they are more readily distinguished by
the nick or some other body-mark than by the face. A difference in
alignment of nicks in a line will readily show the presence of a
wrong-font letter. Typefounders sometimes make an extra nick on a few
small-capitals (o s v w x z) in order to distinguish these types from
the lower-case letters of the same font.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i>A Font of Type</i></h3>

<p>A font of type is an assortment of one size and kind that is used
together. It is usually all the type in the composing-room of a
certain kind matching in body, nick, and face. A small font may be
held in one case, but several cases may be required for a font of
large quantity.</p>

<p>An ordinary font of roman type for book work will include these
characters:</p>

<p><i>Roman Capitals</i>&mdash;A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
&AElig; &OElig;</p>

<p><i>Small Capitals</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
&aelig; &oelig;</span></p>

<p><i>Lower-case Letters</i><small><a name="f2.1" id="f2.1" href="#f2">[2]</a></small>&mdash;a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w
x y z &aelig; &oelig; <span title="[fi] ligature">&#xfb01;</span> <span title="[fl] ligature">&#xfb02;</span> <span title="[ff] ligature">&#xfb00;</span> <span title="[ffi] ligature">&#xfb03;</span> <span title="[ffl] ligature">&#xfb04;</span></p>

<p><i>Figures</i>&mdash;1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 (or oldstyle <img class="inline" src="images/p09a.png" alt="old-style: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0" />)</p>

<p><i>Marks of Punctuation</i>&mdash;Period . comma , colon : semi-colon ; hyphen -
apostrophe &#8217; exclamation mark ! question mark ? parenthesis ( bracket [
The latter two are used in pairs () [], the second type being set in
reversed position.</p>

<p><i>Quotation Marks</i> are made by two inverted commas &#8220; at the beginning
and two apostrophes &#8221; at the end of the quoted matter. In some fonts
there is a double mark |"| |"| cast on single bodies, but these are
not often used.</p>

<p><i>Dashes</i>&mdash;En <span title="en-dash">&#x2013;</span> em &mdash; two-em &mdash;&mdash; three-em &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Reference Marks</i>&mdash;Asterisk or star * dagger <span title="dagger">&#x2020;</span> double
dagger <span title="double dagger">&#x2021;</span> section &sect; parallel <span title="parallel ||">&#x2016;</span> paragraph &para; index (hand, or
fist) <span title="index (hand, or fist)">&#x261e;</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
<i>Braces</i>&mdash;Two-em <img class="inline" src="images/p10a.png" alt="two-em horizontal brace" title="two-em horizontal brace" /> three-em <img class="inline" src="images/p10b.png" alt="three-em horizontal brace" title="three-em horizontal brace" /> pieced
braces <img class="inline" src="images/p10c.png" alt="pieced brace" title="pieced brace" /> made on em bodies, which may be extended more
or less with dashes <img class="inline" src="images/p10d.png" alt="longer pieced brace" title="longer pieced brace" /></p>

<p>The dollar-mark $, short-and (or round-and) &amp;, and sterling pound-mark
&pound; are also included with all full fonts.</p>

<p>The character <img class="inline" src="images/p10e.png" alt="ct ligature" title="ct ligature" /> is an old-style ligature (two joined letters cast
on one type) made in some fonts of old-style faces. It is one of the
many letter combinations formerly common, in imitation of the work of
old manuscript writers.</p>

<p>Many styles of roman types have italic letters to match, but the
italic fonts include only capitals, lower-case, figures, and
punctuation marks:</p>

<p><i>Italic Capitals</i>&mdash;<i>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y
Z &AElig; &OElig;</i></p>

<p><i>Italic Lower-case</i>&mdash;<i>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x
y z &aelig; &oelig;</i></p>

<p><i>Italic Figures</i>&mdash;<i>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0</i> (<img class="inline" src="images/p10f.png" alt="old-style: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0" />)</p>

<p><i>Italic Points, etc.</i><small><a name="f3.1" id="f3.1" href="#f3">[3]</a></small>&mdash;<i>. , : ; - &#8217; ! ? ) $ &amp;</i></p>

<p>Small capitals are not made for italic fonts, except in rare cases.
When they are needed in composition, capitals of a smaller size of
type are justified into the text line.</p>

<p>Other extra characters, not included in ordinary fonts but which may
be added when required, are accented letters (&acirc; &eacute; &euml; <span title="lowercase i with macron above">&#x012b;</span> <span title="lowercase o with macron above">&#x014d;</span> &ucirc; etc.),
fractions &frac34; <span title="fraction 5/13"><small><sup>5</sup></small>&#x2044;<small><sub>13</sub></small></span> etc.), mathematical signs (+ &times; &divide; = etc.),
superior (<sup>ab 42</sup>) and inferior (<sub>ab 12</sub>) letters and figures,
leaders (<span title="leader dots ...">&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;</span>), commercial signs (@ <span title="lb bar">&#x2114;</span> <span title="per sign">&#x214c;</span> <span title="account of">&#x2100;</span> &cent;), and many other characters for special kinds of
printing.</p>

<!--<img class="inline" src="images/p10g.png" alt="lb. bar symbol, per symbol, account of symbol" />-->

<p>Fonts of advertising, jobbing, and display types usually consist of
the capitals, lower-case letters, figures, and points, with
occasionally a few extra characters. For many recent styles of heavy
faces the founders furnish fractions, accented letters, and other
special characters to match in boldness of face, but these are not
included in ordinary letter-fonts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>The quantity of each character apportioned to a regular font is the
estimated average required for ordinary composition in the English
language. It is rare that more than a fraction of a small font can
be used in any piece of composition. No general scheme can meet the
needs of every kind of work; tables and statistical matter will need
extra figures, directories and other lists will call for surplus
capitals, dialogue matter will need more than the usual portion of
commas and apostrophes for quote-marks; even plain descriptive
composition will often call for extra &#8220;sorts.&#8221; For these and other
peculiar kinds of composition extra quantities of some characters,
as well as other material, must be provided.</p>

<p>Ordinary roman and other faces used in large quantities are measured
by weight. The proportion of letters in a 100-pound font, showing the
proportions of each character, is given on the next page.
Miscellaneous faces used in small quantities are put up in fonts
containing a certain number of each letter, the size of the font being
designated by the number of capital A&#8217;s and lower-case a&#8217;s it
contains.</p>

<p>Weight fonts of body type are usually put up by the founders in
sections or parts of fonts as given in the above summary of totals,
so that one or more of these sections may be obtained to supplement a
font already in use.</p>

<p>It will be noted that braces, dashes, and reference-marks are omitted
in the above list. These characters, like fractions, commercial signs,
etc., are not now considered parts of ordinary fonts, but are put up
in separate packages and must be specially ordered when wanted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>Font schemes apportioned in quantities like the foregoing are more or
less closely adhered to for original packages of foundry-cast type. To
insure precision, when ordering, it is necessary to state not only the
quantity (by number of letters or weight) but also whether a complete
font or part of a complete font (capital font, lower-case font, or
figure font) is referred to.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i>The Sizes of Type</i></h3>

<p>All printing type has, first, a name denoting its size, and second,
one denoting the style of its face. For instance, the type used for
the text of this book is 10-point (its size) Lining Caslon Oldstyle
(the foundry name of its face).</p>

<div class="figright">
<a name="image-0004" id="image-0004"><!--IMG--></a>
<a href="images/p13-f.png"><img src="images/p13-s.png" width="100" height="243"
alt="[Diagram of type sizes]" /></a>
</div>

<p>The <i>size</i> of a type is the vertical thickness of its body&mdash;the
thickness of a line up and down the page. The width of a type is its
<i>set</i>. Thus a 12-point en-quad is 12-point body and 6-point set, a
10-point figure of the thickness of an en quad is 10-point body and
5-point set, etc. The total length of a type, including feet and face,
is its <i>height-to-paper</i>.</p>

<p>American type sizes conform to a graduated scale known as the point
system. The unit of the system is a division of space called a
<i>point</i>, which is .0138+ (approximately <sup>1</sup>&#x2044;<sub>72</sub>) of an inch. Type bodies
are multiples of this point.</p>

<p>The usual sizes are graduated by points up to 12-point. Sizes above
18-point are multiples of 6-point up to 60-point (18, 24, 30, 36, 42,
48, 54, 60). Larger sizes are 72-point, 84-point (rare), 96-point,
120-point, and 144-point, the latter being the largest type commonly
cast in a mold.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 160px;">
<a name="image-0005" id="image-0005"><!--IMG--></a>
<a href="images/p14-f.png"><img src="images/p14-s.png" width="150" height="314"
alt="The above squares show one em of the sizes stated. The letters show
the size of face made on the body." /></a><br />
The above squares show one em of the sizes stated. The letters show
the size of face made on the body.
</div>

<p>In addition to the small sizes shown in the accompanying illustration,
there are some intermediate sizes like 5&frac12;-point and 4&frac12;-point,
and type as small as 3-point has been made.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> These are rare, however,
as type smaller than 5&frac12;-point is not practicable for extended use.
These small sizes are employed for special purposes, like miniature
editions of books (parts of the Bible, prayer books, etc.) cut-in
notes, piece-fractions, small borders, special characters, and
occasional words or lines that are required to be put in the smallest
possible space. The size of type known as agate (fourteen lines to an
inch) is considered the common standard of measurement for newspaper
and magazine advertising space.</p>

<p>Many plain types for books, periodicals, etc., are made only in small
sizes. Certain faces are made in a few sizes only, while others are
made in more or less complete series from 6-point to 48-point. The
irregular sizes of 5&frac12;-point, 7-point, 9-point, and 11-point are
mostly roman faces, with companion italics, and a few bolder styles
for headings and other display in combination with romans of the same
body. Many new faces are now made by founders in graded series from
6-point to 72-point, and in some cases even larger. Type faces adapted
to many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> kinds of work are made in nearly all the regular sizes, while
those faces designed for small and dainty work, like personal and
society cards and stationery, are made only in the smaller sizes of
the list.</p>

<p>Types are now often cast with faces larger or smaller than is commonly
made on the body, such as a 12-point face on 10-point body, giving the
effect of compactness; or an 8-point face made on a 10-point body,
which gives a lighter appearance as if opened with 2-point leads.
These are known as bastard types. Because of this irregularity in the
faces of types it is difficult to know the exact body-size of a type
by merely examining a printed sheet.</p>

<p>Borders, ornaments, florets, and decorative characters cast on
type-bodies are now made mostly in sizes based on the 6-point as the
unit (6, 12, 18, 24-point, and larger multiples), but 8-point,
10-point, and 14-point sizes are sometimes used.</p>

<p>Before the adoption of the point system, type sizes were named in a
haphazard way. Arbitrary names were given to certain sizes and in many
cases types of the same name made by different founders varied so much
in size that they could not be used together without great
inconvenience to the printer. Some of these old names still survive
and are applied to the point-system bodies which approximate the old
sizes.</p>

<p>While these old names and their sizes are now nearly obsolete, young
printers should learn the names and associate them with their
corresponding sizes of the point system. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>In the foregoing list there
are several intermediate sizes (16, 20, 22, 28, 32, 40, 44-point)
rarely used for type of recent design. Fonts of these odd sizes may be
sometimes found, and there has been a size of 15-point made, but
little used. These odd sizes are, however, mostly old faces, scripts,
and black-letter, originally cast on old bodies and later, after the
introduction of the point system, made on new point-bodies which are
nearest to their original sizes.</p>

<p>The point system has been applied to the width of types, as well as to
the body-size; that is, the set of each type is fixed at a given
number of points or fraction thereof. This method simplifies in a
degree the process of accurate justification, as each line, though
containing various letters and spaces, is composed of the same number
of units. An advantage over the old method of unrelated widths is in
the saving of time in composition, by reducing the number of different
widths in the characters of the alphabet. By the old method each type
had its own special width; in a complete font there might be a hundred
or more different widths. By the modern point system those characters
which are nearly alike in width are made on the same set, or, if
different, the variation is governed by the standard unit.</p>

</div>

<p>American founders have adopted the practice of casting type-faces on
uniform lining systems, variously known as American line, standard
line, uniform line, etc. The earlier practice was to cast the type of
a font so that the letters would align at the bottom only with their
mates of the same font, without reference to any other face of type.
When the compositor had occasion to use two or more different faces of
type in the same line, these faces were rarely in even alignment, but
were irregularly high or low, as shown in the accompanying example
[<span class="smcap">a</span>]. This lack of uniformity made it necessary when a different face
was used in the line,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> as is often required in jobbing and
advertisements, to use thin leads, cards, or pieces of paper above and
below different parts of the type-line in order to get the faces in
line&mdash;an operation more or less troublesome and expensive. By the
modern lining system, the faces made on any given size of body are
cast to align with each other, as shown in the second example [<span class="smcap">b</span>].
These different faces require no more adjustment than if they were all
of one font.</p>

<p>On different sizes of type the shoulder, or blank space, at the bottom
of the letter increases gradually with the size of the type, so that a
word of small type placed beside a larger size must have some spacing
material below as well as above to keep it in its right alignment.
This necessary difference in the face-alignment of various sizes is
graduated by points, in the lining system, so that when more than one
size type is used in the same line the justification is made by using
point-body leads. This makes the use of slips of card and paper
unnecessary and secures greater accuracy and solidity of the composed
page.</p>

<br />

<p>Faces of radically different style are not, however, all cast on the
same alignment, but are classified into three groups. One group
embraces the majority of type-faces, those having capitals and small
letters, g y p j. Another group embraces fonts of capitals only,
mostly faces known as title letters and combination lining faces
which, having no descenders, may be made lower on the body. A third
group includes those faces having long descenders, like script types,
which must be placed high on the body.</p>

<p>A common class of &#8220;lining&#8221; types for job work are the combination
series, or those having two or more sizes of face (capitals only) cast
on bodies of the same size. Each face is made to line with the others
on the same body, and all the faces are readily used in combination,
with a single size of spaces and quads. In order that the type of each
face may be readily distinguished, the nicks are varied in number or
position&mdash;a single nick for one face, two nicks for another, etc.</p>

<h3><i>Kerned Types</i></h3>

<p>When the face of a letter is so large that it projects over the
type-body, it is known as a kerned type. Letters of this kind are
common in italic and script fonts, and there are a few letters, like f
and j, in some oldstyle roman fonts which have the tip of the letter
overhang. Kerned types are a source of trouble because of the ease
with which these projections break off during composition, proofing,
etc. Yet they cannot be entirely dispensed with, especially in italic
and script faces having a definite slope, where the long letters would
have wide gaps on the side (as shown in the script line above) if they
were cast on bodies wide enough to hold the entire face. In some
styles of upright faces having extra long descending letters g, p, q,
y, these descenders may be kerned.</p>

corners, instead of kerned, to allow the next letter to fit close.
</div>

<p>Modern type-makers try, by changing the shape of the letters slightly,
to avoid kerns as much as possible, because of the extra care and
expense involved in casting. Too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> often, unfortunately, this avoidance
of the kern, in order to meet mechanical convenience, is secured by
sacrificing the distinctive form of the letter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i>Spaces and Quads</i></h3>

<p>Short metal spaces and quads (from <i>quadrat</i>, a square), used for
blanks between words and elsewhere, are of various thicknesses, as
illustrated below. An em is a square of type body of any size. This
10-point em <span style="font-size: 200%;" title="hollow 10-point em square">&#x25a1;</span> is ten points square; a 10-point three-to-em
space is one third of the em, a four-to-em is one fourth, etc. The en
quad is really a thick space, though called a quad, and is equal to
half the em. Larger blanks are the two-em and three-em quads, used to
fill the last lines of paragraphs and other wide spaces.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="image-0012" id="image-0012"><!--IMG--></a>

alt="10-point Spaces and Quads" /></a>
<br />
<!--<span class="smcap">10-point Spaces and Quads</span>-->
</div>

<p>The metal blanks shown here are the regular spaces and quads belonging
to a font of type of the size of 10-point. They enable the compositor
to obtain the many different spacings required to make lines the
required length, and to properly separate words and place them
wherever desired in the line. While these thicknesses of spaces are
the usual kinds for sizes of type up to 12-point, larger types may
have other kinds of spaces, six-to-em, eight-to-em, and even smaller
divisions. The thickness of the hair space does not always bear the
same proportion to the em quad; in some sizes it is one sixth of the
em, in others it may be one eighth or one twelfth. Very thin spaces
(copper &frac12;-point, brass 1-point), for exact spacing and justifying,
are supplied by dealers.</p>

<p>A space of the thickness intermediate between the three-to-em and the
en quad, known as a patent space, has been made for use in book work.
Although it has great advantage as a substitute for two of the thinner
spaces when these are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> needed in spacing a line, its use has been
limited and it is not included with the usual assortment furnished by
dealers.</p>

<p>The common spaces and quads for general work, when the type itself is
used for printing, are about seven-eighths of the height of the type,
so that they are well below the printing surface. A type-page composed
with these spaces will have a little deep hole at the top of each
space. These numerous little holes present a difficult surface for
making a good wax mold when an electroplate is made for printing.
Where much molding is to be done, higher spaces, quads, and other
blanks are provided. These high spaces and quads reach nearly to the
shoulder of the type.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i>How Type is Made</i></h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="image-0013" id="image-0013"><!--IMG--></a>
<a href="images/p20-f.png"><img src="images/p20-s.png" width="250" height="147"
alt="[Diagram of a type mold]" /></a>
<br />
Solid lines indicate one half of the mold. Dotted lines
show the other half in position. Shaded portion represents type metal
filling aperture in the mold. The molten type metal flows through the
opening at <span class="smcap">A</span>, down to the side <span class="smcap">B</span>, where the matrix (not shown in this
diagram) molds the face of the type. The tag of metal, called the jet,
marked <span class="smcap">C</span>, is cut off after casting. <span class="smcap">D</span> is a narrow flange on the mold
which forms the nick on the under surface of the type body.
</div>

<p>The mold in which type is cast consists of two essential parts&mdash;the
steel box in which the body is formed, and the matrix which contains a
sunken image of the character. The matrix covers the opening at one
end of the mold, and on the opposite end (which is the foot of the
type) is an opening through which the melted metal is injected. A mold
is made for a single body-size of type but it is adjustable sideways
to correspond to the various widths of the letters in an alphabet. One
mold may be used to cast, in succession, all the letters of a font of
type, or it may be used to cast any number of fonts of different faces
that may be made on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> same body, by merely changing the matrices
that form the face. The mold is made in two sections, which are
fitted together so as to close up to the required width of the letter,
and, after the cast is made, to open slightly in order to release the
type.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 50px; text-align: center;">

alt="Matrix" /></a>
<br />
Matrix
</div>

<p><i>The Matrix.</i> There are three different methods of making type
matrices. By the oldest method the first step is to cut the character
on the end of a small bar of soft steel, called a punch; when this is
done, the steel is hardened and it is used to stamp an impression in a
bar of copper. This copper bar is a matrix in the rough, and its sides
are next trimmed and squared so that it will fit the mold.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="image-0015" id="image-0015"><!--IMG--></a>
<a href="images/p21b-f.png"><img src="images/p21b-s.png" width="250" height="109"
alt="Type mold, complete, in two parts..." /></a>
<br />
Type-mold complete, in two parts, but without the
matrix (which is shown separately above). Position of the matrix when
cast is made is indicated by the letter <span class="smcap">H</span> on the end of the type
within the mold. The upper and lower halves of the mold slide
horizontally, to make the interior casting-box wide or narrow to
conform to the required widths of various letters.
</div>

<p>The second method of making a matrix is by electrotype process. The
original pattern of the letter may be engraved by hand or by other
operation, or it may be a perfect type-face of a previous casting.
This is fitted into a small frame of brass and then held in the vat of
an electro-galvanic battery, which deposits a thick film of copper
around the pattern and fills the opening in the brass frame. When this
electro-plating process is completed, the pattern letter is extracted
and the brass frame, with its copper impression of the letter, becomes
the essential feature of the matrix. It is then reinforced by riveting
another plate on the back, and is trimmed and fitted to place on the
mold.</p>

<p>A third process of making matrices is with an automatic matrix-cutting
machine, in which the shape of the desired letter is cut in the face
of a plate of composition metal by a small rapidly-revolving cutting
point. A large pattern of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> letter is placed in one part of the
machine, and while the operator traces the outline with the point of a
lever all the motions are duplicated in miniature by the cutting tool
on the bar of metal, which becomes, when completed, a matrix.</p>

<p><i>Casting the Type.</i> The old-time method of casting type was with hand
molds, the melted metal being poured in at the foot of the mold with a
small ladle while the mold was held in the hand. In the modern casting
machine, the mold with its matrix, is assembled by the side of the
metal pot, in which the metal is kept at a uniform temperature by
means of a gas furnace.</p>

<p>In the center of this metal pot is a rod with a spring attachment
which, at each operation of the machine, acts as a plunger to force a
small stream of hot metal through a side aperture into the jet-hole of
the mold. After the casting, the two parts of the mold separate
slightly, the matrix is drawn away from the face of the type, and the
cast is moved out; then the mold and matrix close together again and
the operation is repeated. Cold water or air is circulated near the
mold to keep an even temperature. The matrix for one character only is
placed in the machine and when enough types have been cast, it is
taken out and replaced by another, the change usually requiring but a
few moments.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of type-casting machines in use, such as hand
casters, steam casters, and automatic casters. The older style is the
hand caster, which is operated by a small wheel with a handle
attached. Steam casters are operated by mechanical power (originally
steam power).</p>

<p>When type is cast by a hand machine it is unfinished, as a piece of
metal called the jet still adheres to the bottom of each type. This
jet is broken off, and the types are set in long lines and fastened in
a narrow channel, face down. A small plane smooths away the rough
surface caused by breaking off the jet. This leaves a shallow groove
on the bottom of each type and allows it to stand squarely on its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
feet. The types also have slight burs and sharp edges of metal which
must be rubbed off before they are ready for inspection and for the
font-room. Type cast on the older &#8220;steam&#8221; machines require the jet to
be broken off after the casting, and the final finishing of the type
is done afterward by other operations. These finishing touches are
done mostly by hand, with the aid of a polishing stone or a small
dressing wheel.</p>

<p>On the automatic machine, which is the modern method of casting type,
breaking off the jet, rubbing, dressing, etc., are all accomplished
automatically on the machine, the types coming out in a continuous
line practically ready for the compositor&#8217;s case.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The foregoing describes in a general way the methods of making type by
the regular founders. There is now a great deal of type made by
automatic composing and casting machines installed directly in many
composing rooms.</p>

<p>Two distinctive styles of these machines are now extensively used&mdash;the
Linotype and the Monotype. Both of these have reached a high degree of
efficiency because of their nice mechanisms, based on the principle of
automatically operated molds, matrices, and delivery devices.</p>

<p>In the Linotype the matrices for a desired line of words are assembled
side by side and the line is cast in one piece.</p>

<p>In the Monotype the mechanism automatically and rapidly adjusts the
matrix of the desired letters one at a time over the mold, and each
type is cast and moved along into lines and then into a column on a
galley.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i>The Linotype</i></h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px; text-align: center;">

alt="Four-Magazine Linotype Machine" /></a>
<br />
Four-Magazine Linotype Machine
</div>

<p>The Linotype (line-o&#8217;-type) consists of a mechanism for assembling
brass dies or matrices in lines, presenting them in front of a mold in
which a type-high metal bar, or slug, is cast, and returning the
matrices to their respective<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> channels for use again. The brass
matrices have the characters of the alphabet, figures, points, etc.,
sunk into their edges; these are held in a magazine, which is an
arrangement of channels in an inclined position above a keyboard. By
the pressing of a key the required matrix is released, which drops and
is carried into place by a small belt. Wedge-shaped space-bands are
also controlled by a key, and when sufficient matrices and space-bands
are assembled to make the line a bell rings. By operating a lever the
line of matrices then moves in front of the mold inserted in the side
of a wheel and behind which is a pot of melted metal.</p>

<p>By the next operation the space-bands are pushed between the words,
thus spreading them to the measure. The line justified, a plunger in
the metal-pot forces a quantity of metal into the mold and against the
line of matrices, forming a metal strip or slug with the letters in
relief on one edge. After the cast is made, a turn of the mold-wheel
and other mechanism shaves off the surplus metal on the foot of the
slug and pushes it between knife-edges, where it is trimmed on the
sides, and is then pushed on to a galley. The melting of the metal is
done by a small gas furnace under the metal-pot.</p>

<p>After the matrices have been used for the line they are lifted by an
arm to the top of the machine and distributed again, each character in
its particular channel in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> magazine. The matrices for each
character have a set of notches or teeth different from every other
character; and as they are moved along the distributing apparatus by
horizontal screws each matrix reaches a point where its notches are
matched and it drops into the top of its channel. There are a number
of matrices of each character, and the arrangement of the machine is
such that three lines of matrices may be kept in operation at
once&mdash;one being assembled, one at the casting mold, and the third
being distributed.</p>

<p>The work of the operator is to manipulate the keyboard and, at the end
of each line, move a lever which engages the mechanism that carries
the assembled line to the mold. All other operations are performed by
mechanical power.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Monotype Keyboard
</div>

<p>The Lanston Monotype is a type-casting machine which produces separate
types set in lines of any length, up to sixty ems pica, spaced and
justified. It is in two parts&mdash;a keyboard and a casting machine. The
function of the keyboard section is to punch a series of holes in a
moving strip of paper, which unwinds from one spool to another,
passing under a series of punches in its journey. The punches are
operated by pressing the keys on the keyboard, the result of this
operation being a roll of perforated paper ribbon. This ribbon is then
taken to the casting machine, which contains a pot for melted metal, a
stationary mold for the size of type to be cast, and a matrix-plate.
The matrix-plate is about five inches square, and has on its face
depressed images or matrices of each letter and character of the font.
The perforated strip of paper, when fed to its place, controls the
movement of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> the matrix-plate, so that the required letter is adjusted
exactly in place over the mold, while the melted metal is squirted in
to form the type. The type then moves away and takes its proper place
in the line, until the line is completed, when it is automatically
moved out on to a galley.</p>

<p>The Monotype keyboard, being an entirely separate machine, may be and
usually is operated in any place away from the casting apparatus and
work may be executed on it anytime before casting. The perforated roll
may be fed through any number of times to produce duplicate castings
of the matter, and a matrix-plate for a different face may be used if
desired. In the casting of the line the proper spaces are cast with
it, the spacing needed to justify each line being indicated on the
perforated record during composition on the keyboard.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of Monotype composition is that, while the keyboard
produces the perforated roll in the usual sequence from beginning to
end of the story, the casting machine reverses the process by starting
at the end of the composition and finishing up with the beginning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i>Ingredients of Type Metal</i></h3>

<p>The metal used for casting type is a mixture of lead (five parts),
antimony (two parts), tin (one part), and sometimes a small addition
of copper. Lead forms the chief part of all type metal, as it melts
easily and fuses readily with other metals; but lead alone is too soft
for the service required of type. Antimony is brittle and gives
hardness, and tin is added to impart toughness. Lead and antimony in
approximately these proportions make an alloy which has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> the unusual
quality of expanding slightly, instead of shrinking, when cooling,
thus permitting a full, sharp cast in all parts of the mold. Tin flows
readily when melted and increases the smoothness of the cast on the
surface of the mold. A small quantity of copper may sometimes be added
to give still greater toughness.</p>

<p>The metal used for small sizes of type is commonly harder than that
used for the large sizes, the softness of the metal gradually
increasing with the size of type made. Script types and faces with
delicate lines are usually cast with metal a little harder than that
used for the normal and bolder faces.</p>

<p>The foregoing refers more particularly to type cast by the regular
foundries. The metal used in automatic casting machines, like the
Monotype, contains a larger proportion of lead and less antimony;
while the metal used for casting line-slugs in the Linotype machine is
composed of still larger proportion of lead and very little of the
other two metals. Stereotype metal and metals used for leads, slugs,
furniture, etc., are largely lead.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i>Wood Type</i></h3>

<p>Large types, such as are used for posters and large bills, are made of
wood. The smallest size for practical use is 48-point, or 4-line pica.
Sizes of wood type are multiples of the pica, and are so named, as
8-line, 10-line, etc. They are much cheaper than metal types, though
not as durable or satisfactory for printing. The wood commonly used is
maple, and the letter is made on the end of the grain. It must be well
seasoned and polished. Pine and other soft woods are used for very
large sizes of wood type and poster engravings.</p>

<p>The manner of cutting the letter is by routing away the blank parts
with a small rapidly-revolving cutter. The strip of wood, large enough
to make several letters, and planed type-high, is placed in a machine
equipped with a pantagraph<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> apparatus. A pattern letter is put in
place, and over this a guide-point is moved. On another part of the
machine is the revolving cutting tool. As the guide-point is moved
over the pattern its motions are duplicated on the block under the
cutting tool, which cuts away the wood. When the letters on a block
are thus routed out, they are sawed apart, the finishing touches
given, and the letters oiled.</p>

<h2>REVIEW QUESTIONS</h2>


<h3>SUGGESTIONS TO STUDENTS AND INSTRUCTORS</h3>

<p>The following questions, based on the contents of this pamphlet, are
intended to serve (1) as a guide to the study of the text, (2) as an
aid to the student in putting the information contained into definite
statements without actually memorizing the text, (3) as a means of
securing from the student a reproduction of the information in his own
words.</p>

<p>A careful following of the questions by the reader will insure full
acquaintance with every part of the text, avoiding the accidental
omission of what might be of value. These primers are so condensed
that nothing should be omitted.</p>

<p>In teaching from these books it is very important that these questions
and such others as may occur to the teacher, should be made the basis
of frequent written work, and of final examinations.</p>

<p>The importance of written work cannot be overstated. It not only
assures knowledge of material but the power to express that knowledge
correctly and in good form.</p>

<p>If this written work can be submitted to the teacher in printed form
it will be doubly useful.</p>

<h2>TYPOGRAPHIC TECHNICAL SERIES<br />
FOR APPRENTICES</h2>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">The</span> following list of publications, comprising the <span class="smcap">Typographic
Technical Series for Apprentices</span>, has been prepared under the
supervision of the Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of
America for use in trade classes, in course of printing instruction,
and by individuals.</p>

<p>Each publication has been compiled by a competent author or group of
authors, and carefully edited, the purpose being to provide the
printers of the United States&mdash;employers, journeymen, and
apprentices&mdash;with a comprehensive series of handy and inexpensive
compendiums of reliable, up-to-date information upon the various
branches and specialties of the printing craft, all arranged in
orderly fashion for progressive study.</p>

<p>The publications of the series are of uniform size, 5  8 inches. Their
general make-up, in typography, illustrations, etc., has been, as far
as practicable, kept in harmony throughout. A brief synopsis of the
particular contents and other chief features of each volume will be
found under each title in the following list.</p>

<p>Each topic is treated in a concise manner, the aim being to embody in
each publication as completely as possible all the rudimentary
information and essential facts necessary to an understanding of the
subject. Care has been taken to make all statements accurate and
clear, with the purpose of bringing essential information within the
understanding of beginners in the different fields of study. Wherever
practicable, simple and well-defined drawings and illustrations have
been used to assist in giving additional clearness to the text.</p>

<p>In order that the pamphlets may be of the greatest possible help for
use in trade-school classes and for self-instruction, each title is
accompanied by a list of Review Questions covering essential items of
the subject matter. A short Glossary of technical terms belonging to
the subject or department treated is also added to many of the books.</p>

<p>These are the Official Text-books of the United Typothetae of America.</p>

<p>Address all orders and inquiries to <span class="smcap">Committee on Education, United
Typothetae of America, Chicago, Illinois, U. S. A.</span></p>

<h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">This</span> series of Typographic Text-books is the result of the splendid
co-operation of a large number of firms and individuals engaged in the
printing business and its allied industries in the United States of
America.</p>

<p>The Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of America, under
whose auspices the books have been prepared and published,
acknowledges its indebtedness for the generous assistance rendered by
the many authors, printers, and others identified with this work.</p>

<p>While due acknowledgment is made on the title and copyright pages of
those contributing to each book, the Committee nevertheless felt that
a group list of co-operating firms would be of interest.</p>

<p>The following list is not complete, as it includes only those who have
co-operated in the production of a portion of the volumes,
constituting the first printing. As soon as the entire list of books
comprising the Typographic Technical Series has been completed (which
the Committee hopes will be at an early date), the full list will be
printed in each volume.</p>

<p>The Committee also desires to acknowledge its indebtedness to the many
subscribers to this Series who have patiently awaited its publication.</p>

<b>Transcriber&#8217;s Notes:</b> The original printed text contains a significant
number of characters which are not included in standard ASCII or
ISO-8859-1 encodings. Those glyphs are represented in this file using the numeric entities
of the Unicode characters which accurately represent these glyphs as printed in the original.
These characters have 'title' attributes added to their markup so that in the event
you see the symbol for an unrecognized character, you can hover over it for a description.
Most users should not encounter this issue, but in case it occurs it can be resolved
by installing a font which has broader coverage of the Unicode character set, and/or
enabling font substitution (if it is not enabled by default in your browser/OS settings).

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
